The video, filmed inside HMP Wandsworth in south London, prompted a police investigation. Consequently, De Sousa Abreu was arrested and charged with misconduct in public office.

During a brief hearing at Isleworth Crown Court in west London, De Sousa Abreu appeared in a light-colored suit and brown top. The charge against her stated that she “willfully and without reasonable excuse or justification misconducted herself in a way that amounted to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder by engaging in a sexual act with a prisoner in a prison cell.”

The incident occurred at Wandsworth between June 26 and 28. De Sousa Abreu was arrested at Heathrow Airport while preparing to board a flight to Madrid, having informed the prison of her travel plans. Holding a Portuguese passport, she was granted conditional bail and is scheduled to reappear at Isleworth Crown Court on November 7.

Tetteh Turkson of the Crown Prosecution Service commented on the case, stating, “This was a shocking breach of the public’s trust. De Sousa was clearly an enthusiastic participant who wrongly thought she would avoid responsibility. The CPS recognizes there is no excuse for any prison officer who conducts themselves in such a manner, and we will never hesitate to prosecute those who abuse their position of power.”

He added, “After working closely with the Metropolitan Police to build the strongest possible case, De Sousa had no option but to accept her guilt. She will now rightly face the consequences of her actions.”
